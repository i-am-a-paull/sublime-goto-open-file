##GotoOpenFile (Retired)

*This plugin is no longer updated. The successor was chosen during a cleanout in Package Control (https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/pull/3330). It is at https://github.com/rajeshvaya/Sublime-Extended-Tab-Switcher.*

Sometimes, if you are working on a small subsection of a particularly large
project, Goto Anything might get too distracting. GotoOpenFile brings up a quick
panel that only includes currently-opened tabs.

For tabs in the active group, the default keybinding is ctrl-shift-o (or
cmd-shift-o).

For tabs in the entire window, the default keybinding is alt-shift-o.

By default, tabs are not sorted by name. However, if you would like them to be,
you can set "sort_views" to true.

In your user settings:

```JSON

"GotoOpenFile": {
  "sort_views": true
}

```

To sort case insensitive use ```"sort_views": "ignore_case" ```.
